# Investigating-Customer-Purchase-Behaviour

## Project Background
The Category Manager for Chips, wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.
This project analyses the data from transactions and customer attributes to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviours.

Insights and Recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
1. Sales Volume Per Customer Segment Analysis
2. Brand Affinity
3. Target Customer Segments

The python notebook detailing the whole process from data cleaning to analysis can be found here.


## Data Structure
Chips Supermarket's datasets for the analysis include 2 tables: transaction data and purchase behaviour data with a total row count of 246,740 records.

Prior to the beginning of the analysis, a number of data quality checks such as formatting data types and detecting outliers as well as familiarization with the datasets were conducted. The python codes utilized can be found in the python notebook.


## Executive Summary of Insights

1. Sales have primarily been driven by Budget Older Families, Mainstream Young Singles/Couples, and Mainstream Retirees.
2. The high spending on chips by Mainstream Young Singles/Couples and Retirees can be attributed to their larger numbers compared to other buyers.
3. Mainstream Midage and Young Singles/Couples are more likely to pay a higher price per packet of chips.
4. Kettle, Smiths, Pringles and Doritos brands tend to be the most patronized brands of chips.
5. The strongest brand affinity can be observed between Mainstream Young Singles/Couples and Budget Older Families who happen to be the customer segments driving the highest sales, Older Singles/Couples and Kettle chips. Kettle chips is known to be a healthy potato chip. That may explain the affinity of the older population and premium customers who are health conscious customer segments to the brand.

The remaining graphs can be assessed in the python notebook.


## Recommendations

Given that Budget Older Families, Mainstream Young Singles/Couples, and Mainstream Retirees record the highest sales, targeted promotions and discounts on their most preferred brand of chips could be run for these groups. This could include loyalty programs, bulk purchase discounts, or family-sized packaging options. Mainstream Young Singles/Couples and Midage Singles/Couples are willing to pay more per packet hence, marketing premium or unique flavors and limited-edition chips to them could be considered. Kettle, Smiths, Pringles, and Doritos chips should be prominently displayed and well-stocked, as they are the most patronized brands and Kettle chips specifically, to cater for the health conscious customer segments as well.
